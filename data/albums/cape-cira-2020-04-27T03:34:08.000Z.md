content: "In an effort to escape a dreary winter, K-Lone dove into the tropics on his debut LP, _Cape Cira_, a balmy mix of dreamy UK club styles gilded with sparkling ambiance. Following up on the dancefloor destruction of 2019's [_Sine Language_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/sine-language-ep/1460859837), K-Lone's move to the equator is a savvy move given that _Cape Cira_ works in essentially every setting. The summery escapism shines through on opener \"Yelli\" and maintains it's lit-from-within lustre up until the last note. As warmer temperatures arrive, watch _Cape Cira_ become one of your frequent companions.\n"

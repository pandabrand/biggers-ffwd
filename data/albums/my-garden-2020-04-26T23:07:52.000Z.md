content: "As soon as I dropped the needle on John Carroll Kirby's Stones Throw debut, _My Garden_, Sheba damn near ruined the entire first listen. She noted (correctly) how the lead track, \"Blueberry Beads\", sounds _exactly_ like the Charlie Brown theme song. You all, I can't unhear that shit now. I skip it every time. Quarartine listening is no joke.  The rest of _My Garden_ deviates from Kirby's familiar Moog/DX7 workouts and ventures toawrds Japanese architectural ambiance. Yoshio Suzuki's [_Morning Picture_](https://music.apple.com/us/album/morning-picture/1453369285) serves as a spiritual cousin with its jazzy explorations and new agey meditations. Either you've stopped reading at this point or you're all in. Either way, ignore the cover and afford _My Garden_ a cursory listen. You may just find one of the most curiously playful records of 2020. Like guru Vince Guaraldi.\n"

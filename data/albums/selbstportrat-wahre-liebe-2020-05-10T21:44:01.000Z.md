content: "Master teacher, Hans-Joachim Roedelius, returns to one of his most beloved series forty-one years after it began. Having founded Cluster and Harmonia,  the towering stature of those groups often overshadows Roedelius' rich solo career, but some of the most essential electronic recordings ever made feature just Roedelius and his trusty Farfisa. If you're new to Roedelius solo output, _Wahre Liebe_ serves as the perfect entry point into the 86 year-old artist's timeless soundscapes. One of the year's best from a titan in ambient and electronic spheres.\n"

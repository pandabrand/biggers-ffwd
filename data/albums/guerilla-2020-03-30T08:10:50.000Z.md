content: "Without a doubt, Nazar's _Guerilla_ is Hyperdub's most substantial debut LP since Burial's 2006 masterpiece. Okay, and Jessy Lanza's _Pull My Hair Back_.  \n\nTracing the harrowing aftermath of the Angolan civil war on one family's experience, Nazar drops us directly inside the conflict with militaristic found sound and hauntological sound design, all of which he undergirds with rough kudoro rhthyms. Overwhelmingly intense, for sure, but it's one of most rewarding listening experiences I've had in ages.  _Guerilla_ deserves the effort.\n"

content: "Rumback returns with his dreamy trio of bass, drums, & piano to exlpore the outer edges of improvisation, yet _June Holiday_ always maintains a sense of care and thoughtfulness throughout its wide open spaces. Absolutely essential you pair it with Adam Scott's scorching visuals for [\"Burning Daylight\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaXuXONFoo8&feature=emb_title) for maximum synergy. Perfect for rolling thunderstorms and twilit desert drives.\n"

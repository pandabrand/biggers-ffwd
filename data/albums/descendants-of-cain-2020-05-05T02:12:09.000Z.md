content: "Between Conway's _LULU_, Westside Gunn's _Pray for Paris_, and Ka's _Descendants of Cain_, April 2020 turned into one of the strongest months in Hip Hop since the summer of '95. For me, Ka occupies a lane all his own, where the barely-there, self-produced beats never distract from the artistry of his bewtiching lyricism. Ka's simply without equal and _Descendants of Cain_ cements his status as the undisputed King of Brownswood.\n"

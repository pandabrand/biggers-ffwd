content: "Hiroshi Yoshimura's _Green_ posseses healing powers. Light in the Attic, who was set to reissue _Green_ in May, knows this, which is why they've made it available for streaming immediately. Trust: you _need_ this in your life right now. Crafted in the winter of 1985, _Green_ might be Yoshimura's most patient recording, never in a hurry to reach its destination. If you're new to Yoshimura, _Green_ serves as the perfect entry point into the architectural musician's sterling oeuvre.\n"

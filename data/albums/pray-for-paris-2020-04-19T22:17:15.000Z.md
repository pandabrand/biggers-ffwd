content: "Gotta confess... Westside Gunn wore me out. Dare you to find a bigger Griselda fan, but the GxFR labelhead dropped too much shit, too soon. But _Pray for Paris_ reinvigorates my utter devotion to Buffalo's greatest curator. We've got production from Alchemist, Tyler, the Creator, Daringer, and DJ Premier! Roc Marciano, Conway, Benny, Freddie Gibbs and Tyler drop unforgettable verses. Virgil Abloh crafted the cover. Despite being recorded in two days after Virgil invited him to fashion week, _Pray for Paris_ might be one of Gunner's strongest yet. Get well soon, [_Fly God_](https://youtu.be/-oxXpxsqG8E?t=2015).\n"

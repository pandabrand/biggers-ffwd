content: "Sorry for the silence. Tough couple of weeks.  \nBut Sheba's current obsession with the reissue of Molchat Doma's first two LP's has let in a smudge of gothy light. Consider: Belarusian post-punkers emulating Joy Divison's claustrophic atmospherics with early Cure basslines and skittering drum machines. Perfect recipe for Sheba's love.\n"

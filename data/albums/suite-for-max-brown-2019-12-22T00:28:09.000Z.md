content: "Following up on 2016’s masterful _The New Breed_, Parker presents us with a _Suite for Max Brown_, a heartfelt tribute to his mother—that’s her on the cover! Ruby Parker, Jeff's daughter, welcomes us into the family affair with her honeyed vox on \"Build a Nest\", a lilting entry point into this personal journey through time and legacy. Aside from Ruby and the occasional accompanist, Parker handles every sound on _Suite for Max Brown_, only furthering the diaristic qualities of the LP.    \n\n_Suite for Max Brown_ overwhelms me with unbridled joy. I sincerely hope it does the same for you.\n"

content: "All props to Sheba on this one. I confess _Fetch the Bolt Cutters_ is the first Fiona Apple record I've heard, but Sheba's been jamming it non-stop and it's fantastic. Ramshackle sonics coupled with creative arrangments and expert songwriting makes _Fetch the Bolt Cutters_ such a dizzying listening experience. Earns every ounce of its hype with Apple's sheer musical physicality and unvarnished humanity.\n"

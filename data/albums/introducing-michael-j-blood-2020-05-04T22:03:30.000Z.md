content: "Most blunted gear I've heard since Actress' earliest cuts, no lie. Spread across four twenty-minute sections, Blood conjures the scene of a Manchester pirate radio tranmission fueled by an ungodly amount of glass-tipped pre-rolled's. All of it sounds like Moodymann, Theo Parrish, John T. Gast paying homage to Prince and Dilla with just some Sour Diesel and an MPC 2000. If you worship any of the aforementioned, _Introducing Michael J. Blood_ is absolutely essential.  \n_No one's even reading this, but don't forget to click the album artwork to download if there isn't Apple Music link for streaming._\n"

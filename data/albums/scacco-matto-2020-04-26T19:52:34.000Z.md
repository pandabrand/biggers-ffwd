content: "First time Kode 9, Hyperdub's label boss, met Lorenzo Senni, he said, \"You don't smoke weed.\" Senni was speechless. \"How'd you _know_?!\" he asked. Kode noted how Senni’s sound signature was so bright and midrange-y, how it lacked the slow, sunken stupor of beats smudged with sativa and resin. In fact, there were _no_ beats at all. Senni admitted it was the first time someone figured out he’d grown up straight edge in the Rimini hardcore punk scene just from the sonic details of his compositions.  With _Scacco Matto_, the Italian Pointillist rave voyeur, or whatever the fuck, delivers the swan song to this particular phase of his career, and it’s his best record yet. Call it glorious overstimulation because _Scacco Matto’s_ eight tracks overwhelm the senses with sugary blasts of serotonin and candied rhythms—all without a single drum hit. Despite mining the maligned palette of trance, Senni transcends the genre's treacherous sonics with a supernatural gift with melodic rhythm.  \nUnless you consume five Red Bulls a day like Senni, _Scacco Matto's_ sugary arpeggios and buzzy chord stabs might overwhelm your senses. I get it. If that's the case, just promise me you'll try “Canone Infiniti”, the swirling centerpiece of _Scacco Matto_. Although the majority of Senni’s work utilizes the super-saw waves from the Roland JP-8080, a trance workhorse, “Canone Infiniti” introduces an unfamiliar Senni sound — a digi Wurlitzer circulating a 8/10 pattern that stretches into infinity. But it’s not until the top-line emerges around the 0:40 mark where the walls fall away and the floor disappears...and we’re suddenly floating. The lilting melody sweeps across the stereo field (with the perfect amount of wow and flutter!) as Senni manipulates his synth's envelope in a way that resembles palm-muted guitar strings. It’s simply the most gorgeous song on one of my favorite records of the year. \nDecaf drinkers should avoid at all costs.\n"

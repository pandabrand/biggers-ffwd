content: "I hate guitar solos. _Loathe_. Which makes no sense because guitar was my first instrumentâ€”I've studied jazz guitar for years. Still, if Grant Green isn't playing it, I'm not fucking with it. \nAnd yet one of the most egregious guitar solos in recent memory erupts in the middle of \"Kerosene!\", the lead single from Yves Tumor's immediately accessible _Heaven to a Tortured Mind_. I woudn't say I'm _okay_ with the solo, but I fully support Yves' urge to shred. This is their moment. I miss the enigmatic experimentation from Yves' previous efforts, but _Heaven to a Tortured Mind_ confirms the arrival of what I assumed was extinct: a genuine rock star.\n"

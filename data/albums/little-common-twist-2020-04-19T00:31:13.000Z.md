content: "I cannot jam _Little Common Twist_ without clutching the record sleeve in my hands as I watch the pink vinyl go by. Feel like itâ€™s the marriage of Adam Scott's lush artwork with Charles Rumback & Ryley Walker's sparse instrumentation that evokes such a vast visual universe. My mind's eye often wanders to Harry Dean Stanton ambling through the desert in the opening moments of _Paris, TX._, yet the duo have crafted a distinctly Chicago record. From John Hughes' spartan production to Rumback's free jazz explorations, _Little Common Twist_ expands upon the very best of Chicago's audio/visual ethos. Another Sheba-approved joint.\n"

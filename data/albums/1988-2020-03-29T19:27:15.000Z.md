content: "_1988_ is the perfect encapsulation of Pleather Jacuzzi, the vinyl-only DJ night Fred and I have hosted for almost a decade. Born out of a mutual adoration of new jack swing, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Teddy Riley productions, Pleather Jacuz' mainly consists of Fred working his mixing magic while I spin the same Toni Brxton, SWV, and Destiny's Child 12's over and over.  \n\n Knxwledge blesses us with a dreamy mixtape brimming with quiet storm burners, slow jam R&B, and classic MPC hip-hop for backpacking dads. We could drop _1988_ and jam that shit for four hours straight and no one would notice. \n Far and away the most fun record of 2020.  \n\n Straight up: if _1988_ doesn't make you _smile_, you might be an asshole.\n"

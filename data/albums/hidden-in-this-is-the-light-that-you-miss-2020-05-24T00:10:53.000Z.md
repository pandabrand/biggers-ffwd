content: "Regis breaks twenty years of silence with _Hidden In This Is The Light That You Miss_, a jet black pearl of icy space and rhythmic noise. O'Connor cements the record's industrial bonafides by collaborating with Einstürzende Neubauten’s engineer/producer Boris Wilsdorf for what might be his most brutally absorbing album yet. Eyeliner's essential. Absolutely peerless.\n"

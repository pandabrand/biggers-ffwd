content: "Drew Daniel's Soft Pink Truth moniker stolen my heart for almost two decades with his take on left-field house, electro, and everything in between, but nothing he's done in Matmos or as S.P.T. could've prepared me for the revelatory _Shall We Go On Sinning So That Grace May Increase?_. What began as an emotional response to rising facism around the globe, Daniels utilized his creativity as a form of self-care and crafted his most joyous and gracious record yet. It's almost devotional in it's grace and gratitude. Truly one of the year's best.\n"

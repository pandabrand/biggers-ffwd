content: "OMGHFS Moodymann dropped his latest joint on us with nary a blip and it's fucking _fantastic_. _Taken Away_ finds KDJ at his most gospely, bluesy, and danciest self. Pre and post-Reverend Al Green samples flit across the LP, along with the live jazzed-out house he established almost twenty-six years ago. Let's go rollerskating! \n\nIn a year or two.\n"

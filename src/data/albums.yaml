       Sheba and I are *essentially* divorced...
       Musically speaking, that is. Sheba maintains her vinyl-only collection of the scuzziest Reagan-era punk this side of the Bowery, while I trundle the diminishing returns of global youth culture. Out of the two hundred+ records below, Sheba approves of four.  Four. Fucking.  Records.  Not even enough to count on her adorably tiny thumb. (Officially, they are La Luz, Khruangbin, Amen Dunes and Beak>.) I mention this because the first time she caught me listening to Rosalias El Mar Querer, she asked: Whats this—Spanish Miley Cyrus? What a little hosebag, right?

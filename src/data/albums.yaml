       Beatrice sets the bar impossibly high for 2020 with *Workaround*, her stunning debut for PAN.  
       Featuring a delectable suite of fractal polyrhythms and minimalist dub workouts (without a scrinch of delay or reverb), *Workaround's* revolutionary genius continues to blossom upon every listen.  
       Honestly, how does anyone top this? Even Sheba *adores* it—first one of the new century?!    
       Don’t care if I'm hyperbolic and it's fuck early, *Workaround* is the AOTY to beat.    
       Utterly *poifect*.

       Following up on 2016’s masterful *The New Breed*, Parker presents us with a *Suite for Max Brown*, a heartfelt tribute to his mother—that’s her on the cover! Ruby Parker, Jeff's daughter, welcomes us into the family affair with her honeyed vox on "Build a Nest", a lilting entry point into this personal journey through time and legacy. Aside from Ruby and the occasional accompanist, Parker handles every sound on *Suite for Max Brown*, only furthering the diaristic qualities of the LP.    
       
       *Suite for Max Brown* overwhelms me with unbridled joy. I sincerely hope it does the same for you.

    content: | 
      *1988* is the perfect encapsulation of Pleather Jacuzzi, the vinyl-only DJ night Fred and I have hosted for almost a decade. Born out of a mutual adoration of new jack swing, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, and Teddy Riley productions, Pleather Jacuz' mainly consists of Fred working his mixing magic while I spin the same Toni Brxton, SWV, and Destiny's Child 12's over and over.  
       
       Knxwledge blesses us with a dreamy mixtape brimming with quiet storm burners, slow jam R&B, and classic MPC hip-hop for backpacking dads. We could drop *1988* and jam that shit for four hours straight and no one would notice. 
       Far and away the most fun record of 2020.  
       
       Straight up: if *1988* doesn't make you *smile*, you might be an asshole.

    content: |
       Without a doubt, Nazar's *Guerilla* is Hyperdub's most substantial debut LP since Burial's 2006 masterpiece. Okay, and Jessy Lanza's *Pull My Hair Back*.  

       Tracing the harrowing aftermath of the Angolan civil war on one family's experience, Nazar drops us directly inside the conflict with militaristic found sound and hauntological sound design, all of which he undergirds with rough kudoro rhthyms. Overwhelmingly intense, for sure, but it's one of most rewarding listening experiences I've had in ages.  *Guerilla* deserves the effort.

    content: |
           Uganda’s Nyege Nyege Tapes continue to abso-fuckin'-lutely destroy the game with *Metal Preyers*, a blazing transmission from an enigmatic duo split between London and Chicago. Recorded with a group of Ugandan street musicians during a six-week stay in Kampala, *Metal Preyers'* intoxicating blend of singeli and electro-acholi contains the headiest shit from NNT yet.

       Pop ambient for the shoegazer set. I use *Illusion of Time* like an anti-anxiety lozenge.

    content: | 
           A seamless 50-minute odyssey featuring psychedelic dembow, ambient dancehall, and smudged reggaeton, *Mas Amable* serves as DJ Python's defining statement in a career filled with stratospheric highs. This one's strictly for the hips.

            A schizophrenic opus (still without a release date) from this genreation's Madonna, Missy Elliot, and Björk—often all at once. Still unsure of *KiCk i's* stylistic whiplashing from track-to-track, but I'm willing to put in the work.

         Hiroshi Yoshimura's *Green* posseses healing powers. Light in the Attic, who was set to reissue *Green* in May, knows this, which is why they've made it available for streaming immediately. Trust: you *need* this in your life right now. Crafted in the winter of 1985, *Green* might be Yoshimura's most patient recording, never in a hurry to reach its destination. If you're new to Yoshimura, *Green* serves as the perfect entry point into the architectural musician's sterling oeuvre.

              Surprise drop of solo piano recordings from the Solange whisperer and Moog-funk auteur. Essential for quiet introspection, nocturnal ablutions, and pre-bed rituals. Aural ambien.

             I hate guitar solos. *Loathe*. Which makes no sense because guitar was my first instrument—I've studied jazz guitar for years. Still, if Grant Green isn't playing it, I'm not fucking with it. 
             And yet one of the most egregious guitar solos in recent memory erupts in the middle of "Kerosene!", the lead single from Yves Tumor's immediately accessible *Heaven to a Tortured Mind*. I woudn't say I'm *okay* with the solo, but I fully support Yves' urge to shred. This is their moment. I miss the enigmatic experimentation from Yves' previous efforts, but *Heaven to a Tortured Mind* confirms the arrival of what I assumed was extinct: a genuine rock star.

           Gorgeously spooky sounds from Fujita Yosuke, a sound artist who custom-built the pipe organ you can hear creaking as he struggles to control its wavering pitch. Inspired by traditional Japanese gagaku, a form of classical court music from the 7th century, the results evoke a serene sense of calm despite the tremendous effort required to play these pieces. Perfect for drawing the eyelids to half-mast.

          Sorry for the silence. Tough couple of weeks.   
          But Sheba's current obsession with the reissue of Molchat Doma's first two LP's has let in a smudge of gothy light. Consider: Belarusian post-punkers emulating Joy Divison's claustrophic atmospherics with early Cure basslines and skittering drum machines. Perfect recipe for Sheba's love.

             Suffering quarantine alongside some of the most...*discerning* set of ears in existence presents its own set of challenges. I often find myself curating playlists to evade Sheebie's ire.

          I cannot jam *Little Common Twist* without clutching the record sleeve in my hands as I watch the pink vinyl go around. Feel like it’s the marriage of Adam Scott's lush artwork with Charles Rumback & Ryley Walker's sparse instrumentation that evokes a such vast visual universe. My mind's eye often wanders to Harry Dean Stanton ambling through the desert in the opening moments of *Paris, TX.*, yet the duo have crafted a distinctly Chicago record. From John Hughes' spartan production to Rumback's free jazz explorations, *Little Common Twist* expands upon the best of Chicago's audio/visual ethos. Another Sheba-approved joint.

          Gotta confess... Westside Gunn wore me out. Dare you to find a bigger Griselda fan, but the GxFR labelhead dropped too much shit, too soon. But *Pray for Paris* reinvigorates my utter devotion to Buffalo's best curator. We've got production from Alchemist, Tyler, the Creator, Daringer, and DJ Premier! Roc Marciano, Conway, Benny, Freddie Gibbs and Tyler drop unforgettable verses. Virgil Abloh crafted the cover. Despite being recorded in two days after Virgil invited him to fashion week, *Pray for Paris* might be one of Gunner's strongest yet.

    content: 
           When Kode 9, Hyperdub's label boss, first met Lorenzo Senni, he said, "You don't smoke weed." Senni was speechless. "How'd you *know*?!" he asked. Kode noted how Senni's music was so bright and midrange-y, how it lacked the slow, sunken stupor of beats smudged with sativa and resin. There weren't any beats whatsoever. Senni noted it was the first instance of anyone figuring out he had grown up straight edge in the Rimini hardcore punk scene just from the sonic characteristics of his music.  With *Scacco Matto*, the Italian Pointillist rave voyeur, or whatever the fuck, delivers his swan song to this particular phase of his career, and it’s his best record yet. Call it glorious overstimulation, because Scacco Matto’s eight tracks overwhelms the senses with sugary blasts of serotonin and candied rhythms—all without a single drum hit. Senni somehow transcends the maligned palette of Trance through his supernatural gift of melodic rhythm.  According to iTunes, I have listented to “Canone Infiniti”, the swirling centerpiece of *Scacco Matto*, more than any other song in 2020. While most of Senni’s work centers around the super-saw waves of the Roland JP-8080, a trance workhouse, “Canone Infiniti” begins with an unfamiliar Senni sound — a digi Wurlitzer circulating an eight bar pattern that stretches into infinity. But it’s not until the topline emerges around the 0:40 mark where the walls fall away and the floor disappears, and we’re suddenly floating. The lilting melody sweeps across the stereo field (with the perfect amount of wow and flutter!) as Senni manipulates his synth's envelope in a way that resembles palm-muting guitar strings. It’s simply the most gorgeous song on one of my favorite records of the year.

           John Carroll Kirby comes correct with his Stones Throw debut, *My Garden*. Sheba damn near ruined it for me when she noted how much the lead track, "Blueberry Beads", sounds *just* like the Charlie Brown song. I can't unhear it now, you all... Gotta skip it every time now.
           The rest of *My Garden* deviates from Kirby's Moog/DX7 workouts and ventures into Japanese architectural ambiance. Yoshio Suzuki's [*My Garden*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/morning-picture/1453369285) serves as a spiritual cousin with its jazzy explorations and new agey meditations. Either you've stopped reading at this point or you're all in. Either way, float a little time to *My Garden* and you may find one of the most curiously playful records of 2020.

            A dense tapestry of sparkling electronics and spiritual jazz, Maxwell Sterling's new joint requires some time and patience to fully reveal itself. Despite clocking in at a scant 45, these four sprawling tracks defy quick consumption with their intricate details and sonic secrets. Best to let it just wash over you on the first go-around. Then repeat for maximum immersion.

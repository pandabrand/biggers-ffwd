       Sheba and I are _essentially_ divorced!

       Musically speaking, that is. Sheba maintains her vinyl-only collection of the scuzziest Reagan-era punk this side of the Bowery, while I trundle the diminishing returns of global youth culture. Out of the two hundred+ records below, Sheba approves of four.

       Four.

       Fucking.

       Records.

       Not even enough to count on her adorably tiny thumb. (Officially, they are La Luz, Khruangbin, Amen Dunes and Beak>.) I mention this because the first time she caught me listening to Rosalias El Mar Querer, she asked: "Whats this—Spanish Miley Cyrus?" What a little hosebag, right?

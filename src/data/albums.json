Even Sheba *adores* it\u2014first one of the new century?!    \nDon\u2019t care if I'm hyperbolic and it's fuck early, *Workaround* is the AOTY to beat.    \nUtterly *poifect*. \n",

Ruby Parker, Jeff's daughter, welcomes us into the family affair with her honeyed vox on \"Build a Nest\", a lilting entry point into this personal journey through time and legacy. Aside from Ruby and the occasional accompanist, Parker handles every sound on *Suite for Max Brown*, only furthering the diaristic qualities of the LP.    \n\n*Suite for Max Brown* overwhelms me with unbridled joy. I sincerely hope it does the same for you.   \n",

We could drop *1988* and jam that shit for four hours straight and no one would notice. \n Far and away the most fun record of 2020.  \n \n Straight up: if *1988* doesn't make you *smile*, you might be an asshole.  \n",

Overwhelmingly intense, for sure, but it's one of most rewarding listening experiences I've had in ages.  *Guerilla* deserves the effort.\n",

      "content": "First time Kode 9, Hyperdub's label boss, met Lorenzo Senni, he said, \"You don't smoke weed.\" Senni was speechless. \"How'd you *know*?!\" he asked. Kode noted how Senni\u2019s sound signature was so bright and midrange-y, how it lacked the slow, sunken stupor of beats smudged with sativa and resin. In fact, there were *no* beats at all. Senni admitted it was the first time someone figured out he\u2019d grown up straight edge in the Rimini hardcore punk scene just from the sonic details of his compositions.  With *Scacco Matto*, the Italian Pointillist rave voyeur, or whatever the fuck, delivers the swan song to this particular phase of his career, and it\u2019s his best record yet. Call it glorious overstimulation because *Scacco Matto\u2019s* eight tracks overwhelm the senses with sugary blasts of serotonin and candied rhythms\u2014all without a single drum hit. Despite mining the maligned palette of trance, Senni transcends the genre's treacherous sonics with a supernatural gift with melodic rhythm. Unless you consume five Red Bulls a day like Senni, *Scacco Matto's* sugary arpeggios and buzzy chord stabs might overwhelm your senses. I get it. If that's the case, just promise me you'll try \u201cCanone Infiniti\u201d, the swirling centerpiece of *Scacco Matto*. Although the majority of Senni\u2019s work utilizes the super-saw waves from the Roland JP-8080, a trance workhorse, \u201cCanone Infiniti\u201d introduces an unfamiliar Senni sound \u2014 a digi Wurlitzer circulating a 8/10 pattern that stretches into infinity. But it\u2019s not until the top-line emerges around the 0:40 mark where the walls fall away and the floor disappears...and we\u2019re suddenly floating. The lilting melody sweeps across the stereo field (with the perfect amount of wow and flutter!) as Senni manipulates his synth's envelope in a way that resembles palm-muted guitar strings. It\u2019s simply the most gorgeous song on one of my favorite records of the year. Decaf drinkers should avoid at all costs.",

She noted (correctly) how the lead track, \"Blueberry Beads\", sounds *exactly* like the Charlie Brown theme song. You all, I can't unhear that shit now. I skip it every time. Quarartine listening is no joke.  The rest of *My Garden* deviates from Kirby's familiar Moog/DX7 workouts and ventures toawrds Japanese architectural ambiance. Yoshio Suzuki's [*Morning Picture*](https://music.apple.com/us/album/morning-picture/1453369285) serves as a spiritual cousin with its jazzy explorations and new agey meditations. Either you've stopped reading at this point or you're all in. Either way, ignore the cover and afford *My Garden* a cursory listen. You may just find one of the most curiously playful records of 2020. Like guru Vince Guaraldi.",
